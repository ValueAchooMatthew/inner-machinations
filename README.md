# Inner Machinations
***Inner machinations is still in progress***
Inner Machination is a project built using Rust, Tauri, SvelteKit, and MySQL. I was inspired to make this project from my studies into discrete math at university, with the goal of being able to allow anybody, anyewhere to create and visualize deterministic/non-deterministic finite automata, which have immense and significant applications ranging from pattern matching to compiler theory.
To check up on the continued status of the project, take a look at the KanBan board, which I routinely update with additional features. Once a minimimal viable version of the project is complete, I hope to be able to distribute open source and for free to everybody.
